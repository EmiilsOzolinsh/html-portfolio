        <h1>The Best movies according to Emils</h1>
        <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
        <hr/>

        <h3>Howls moving castle</h3>
        <p>A very cinematically beautiful film with characters you just fall in love with. 
            I won't lie, the plot is very hard to follow. If you've 
            read the book, you can tell that miyazaki focused less on following 
            the plot, more on making the film beautiful to watch, and as a result
             we are left with a story that has huge chunks missing and frankly 
             doesn't make a lot of sense in places. But I'm not mad, because 
             it is very, very beautiful to watch.</p>

        <h3>The talented Mr.Ripley</h3>
        <p>The Talented Mr. Ripley, her first Ripley novel, published in 1955, 
            shows Ripley in the process of inventing himself and finding his 
            life's work. He was a poor man who wanted to be a rich man, an 
            unknown man who wanted not to be famous but simply to be someone else.
             Some men are envious of other men's cars, or wives, or fortunes.
             Ripley coveted their identities.</p>

        <h3>The Grand Budapest Hotel</h3>
        <p>Wes Anderson's films are really hard to describe or define.
             Suffice to say that he is unique in his style--very unique. 
             This uniqueness is what makes "The Grand Budapest Hotel" worth 
             seeing. It's an odd story where a story is told within a story--and
              it's filled with famous actors making lots of odd cameos. 
              And, like Anderson's other films, it's full of odd characters, 
              unusual dialog and brisk-paced editing. And, not surprisingly,
               it's NOTHING like other films by other directors.</p>
